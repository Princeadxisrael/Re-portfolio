    "text": "Hi, I’m Prince Israel\nI research and build decentralized distributed systems/protocols, virtual machines, data-intensive and compute-intensive systems. I think of myself as a bridge between decentralized systems, parellel compute, systems engineering and research writing.\nI am a member of the 3uild Ethos team where I have been focused on driving technological innovations within the developer and research community. My primary projects have been related to protocol research, distributed computing systems, cryptography and quantum computing systems. I currently serve the team as the research operations and programs lead. I also work with Solana foundation to research and improve painpoints on the devEx landscape and maintain solanastackexchange."
